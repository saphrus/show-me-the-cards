# Quick start

See the dist folder for compiled resources. (open /dist/index.html in your browser)

# Building the project yourself

You will need gulp (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) in order to build the project.
To use gulp you will need npm (e.g. https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (node.js comes packaged with npm))

Simply run the gulp default task (or the build task, if you like).

Other gulp tasks:
- ``archive:create_archive_dir``
- ``archive:zip``
- ``clean``
- ``copy``
- ``copy:.htaccess``
- ``copy:index.html``
- ``copy:jquery``
- ``copy:license``
- ``copy:main.css``
- ``copy:normalize``
- ``lint:js``
- ``compress``
- ``archive``

see the file gulp.js for more details
